A pickleball court is a rectangular playing area measuring 20 feet wide by 44 feet long. It is divided by a net and includes a non-volley zone (kitchen) on both sides. The court has clear lines that mark the baseline, service courts, and the non-volley zone, ensuring fair gameplay and strategic positioning during matches.</div>

    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <p>
        Here is a brief list of some key rules in pickleball: 
        
        <br> -Serving: The serve must be made diagonally and underhand, with the paddle contacting the ball below the waist. The serve must clear the non-volley zone (kitchen) on the opponent's side.
        
        <br> -Double Bounce Rule: After the serve, both teams must let the ball bounce once on their side before hitting it volleys are not allowed in the non-volley zone.
        
        <br> -Non-Volley Zone (Kitchen): Players cannot volley the ball (hit it in the air without letting it bounce) while inside the non-volley zone. They can only volley after both teams have hit a groundstroke.
        
        <br> -Faults: Common faults include stepping into the non-volley zone and hitting the ball out of bounds or into the net on the serve.
        
        <br> -Scoring: Points are only awarded to the serving team. Games are usually played to 11 points, and players must win by a margin of two points.
        
        <br> -Fault Serve: If the serve hits the net and does not go over or lands out of bounds, it is considered a fault, and the opposing team gets the serve.
        
        <br> -Let Serve: If the served ball touches the net but lands in the proper service court, it is considered a "let" and the serve is replayed.</p>
