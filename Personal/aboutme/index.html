<hr>
        
            <p> My name is Aaron Heiner. I was born and raised in Nampa, Idaho 
            There are nine people in my family with me being the 3rd child. 
            </p>
            <p title="This is my second paragraph"> I played tennis in middle school and have enjoyed playing that but about 3 years
                 ago I discovered pickleball which our family has loved to play. My current 
                  major is software development and I hope that I enjoy it enough to stick with it.</p> 
            
            <p> I, with my family, have been a member of the church my whole life. I served a 
                mission in the north of Chile. I grew to love the people and the food down there 
                which consists of hotdogs with lots of mayo.</p>
