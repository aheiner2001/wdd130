      <div id="Paris" class="tabcontent" style="display: none;">
        <h3>Ball</h3>
        <p>The pickleball is a small plastic ball used in the sport of pickleball. It is specifically designed for this racquet sport, which combines elements of tennis, badminton, and ping pong.

            Pickleballs are made of durable plastic and have perforated holes on their surface. These holes help to reduce the ball's speed and improve control during gameplay. The ball is slightly smaller than a tennis ball, allowing for quick and precise shots.
            
            Overall, the pickleball is a small, perforated plastic ball designed for the unique demands of pickleball, providing players with control and maneuverability on the court.</p>

        <h3>Clothing</h3>
        <p>For pickleball, it is recommended to wear comfortable and breathable athletic attire, such as moisture-wicking shirts and shorts/skirts that allow for a wide range of movement. Choose court-specific shoes for stability and grip. Consider wearing a hat/visor and sunglasses for sun protection.</p>
